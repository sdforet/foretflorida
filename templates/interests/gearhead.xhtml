         <h1>2012 Genesis 5.0</h1>
         <p>
            After buying my wife a Genesis 3.8 sedan I fell in love with this platform.
            I was looking for a car which was less than 5 years old, cost less than 30K, and has more than 400 horses.
            The Genesis 5.0 sedan was the only car that met all of these criteria. I have not been disapointed
            with my purchase. Since buying the Genesis, I have upgraded the exhaust system by deleting the 2nd cats,
            upgrading the intermedate pipes to 2.5" true-dual (no-crossover), and tuned the exhaust sound by using
            28" Thrush glass packs and Modified DynoMax VT's at the rear. I am also, using K&amp;N highflow filters.
            I estimate about 20 or so extra HP out of this arrangment since my 0-60 times improved from 5.1
            to 4.6 seconds. That makes my family sedan a 450HP sleeper that can outperform any Mustang GT, Camaro SS,
            Corvette LS1/2, BMW 550, and Mercedes E350/SL550.

         <h1>2016 Mercedes AMG gt2</h1>
         <p>
            Its one thing to have a car that can go fast... its another thing to do it in extreme luxury, while
            preserving the exileration of a true "driver's" car. Motor Trend named this car it's 2016 Drivers Car of
            the Year, and I agree it is spectacular. Apart from the high performance and striking goo looks, MT
            described this car as the greatest true grand tourer. A car that you can not only blast away competition
            at the track (or red light), but drive comfortably across the country. As an audiophile, the soud of a
            well tuned powerhouse is almost as imporant as the power is produces, listen to AMG explain the
            exhaust tuning... "<em>the AMG Dynamic Performance Exhaust can actively bypass its rear muffler,
            unleashing the... unmistakable symphony of snarling revs, open-throttle cresendos, and crackling
            deceleration"</em>. I can't wait to get my hands on one of these.

            Lets face it, IF I am ever lucky enough to own the AMG gt2 why not dream of owning its grand-father, the
            heavy weight champ, AMG-McLaren SLR. This car, in my opinion, is the pinacle of design performance
            and luxury. Mmmm... (insert dream sequence here...) Supercharged 640 HP V8, need I say more?

               This car is a beutiful example of American imagination and engineering mastery. Unfortunately,
               in order to play in this class you have to opt for the Z06, which is still the lowest priced
               supercar on the market today. Time will tell if this car has good reliability and holds its value.

            <p>
               This is a nice example of ultra modern meets british class. This car looks right at home sitting
               next to its cousin, the Aston Martin DB-<i>S</i>. The base model does not meet the performance
               of this class so I will have to opt for the "R". IT has been reported by Car & Driver that the
               f-type has a rough ride, and some jittery suspension. At the right price, I think a used f-type R
               would be a strong contenter, if only based upon the ferocious sound.

               BMW M division has long been a top player in the best drivers car market. The M6 is in my opinion the
               top of their sport offering. The V8 this car is absolutely menacing. Since this Bimmer will lose
               nearly 50% of its value in the first year alone, its used market only. The M6 is a difficult find,
               but definitely a contender.
