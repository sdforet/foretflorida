            This includes audio formats, audio equipment, and processes. Audiophile's usually have "trained" ears and are able to distinguish the difference between high quality and low quality encoding and/or components through blind testing.

            From the moment my Aperion Intimus 6T system arrived, I knew they were special. The folks at Aperion carefully packed my new speakers in a padded-box within a padded-box and each speaker in an individual satin-lined, gold-pull-rope purple velvet bag (Think giant Crown Royal&reg; bag). The build quality, internal components, and attention to detail of Aperion's team is exceptional. Unfortunately Aperion discontinued the 6T when the Veras line was released.

         <p>
            These speakers have faithfully served as my mains since early 2007 without missing a beat. Their tone was initially a bit tighter and brighter than I preferred, but with age comes wisdom and the Aperions have aged very well. They now have a smooth, quick, and very transparent sound stage with incredible dynamic range. I routinely switch the towers to operate full range without the sub for some stereo music sessions and they are wonderful. When used with the SVS in full theater operation, they have the ability to cause instand fear and panic to the unsuspecting visitor. Makes me smile.

            Reviewers are rarely in agreement about any product in the audio/video spectrum, but with this one they gave it a unanimous reccomendation. As an early adopter of Blu-ray, I was burned a few times by lack of, or slow to upgrade, firmware. The early days were frustrating. I would bring home a newly released disc and my $300 player would turn into a shiny paper weight. The Oppo will play any disc I own, and thanks to its video processing, makes my considerable DVD collection enjoyable in the light available HD content. This was well worth the $599 investment.

            I have recently upgraded from a Pioneer Elite VSX-80TXV THX certified reciever which had been performing regularly in our system for since 2007. While using the Elite I considered it to be one of the best sounding AVRs on the planet. I was wrong. Don't misunderstand, the Pioneer Elite was a very good AVR and performed admirably for a long time. Once the Marantz SR-7008 was hooked up, it opened up my sonic perception. The only thing I can compare it to... was when I was a young boy I needed glasses. My life before glasses was fine, or so I thought. Once experiencing the clarity of 20/20, I could not go back. It was like seeing (i.e. hearing) for the first time. The Marantz SR-7008 was that much of a audio revelation in my system.

            My favorite system component by a long shot is my SVS PB12 Plus/2 subwoofer. The build quality and performance is second to none. Due to this exceptional component I am really leaning towards an ultra system for my next upgrade. Reviewers are nearly unanimous in their appreciation for this system and the price isn't terrible either. The system price for the surrounds/center is $2699 and the front towers are $999 each. A grand total for a premium audio speaker package is $4697.00 with free shipping! SVS is definitely at the top of my list for my next speaker upgrade.

            Some say you can't be a true audiophile unless you have separates. I say, blah. I can appreciate the difference between my system, and the run-of-the-mill big box set up. When budjet constraints stop your expression of a passion, it doesn't minimize your passion. It only fuels your appreciation and drives you to achieve more. When I can, I do intend on employing separates like the items available from Emotiva. Once I win the lottery, or invent some widget that changes the world, then I will have a no holds barred McIntosh monoblock assigned to each of my 40 speaker B&W surround setup. Until then, I can dream.
