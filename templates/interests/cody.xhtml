      <h3>Your parents have decided to buy you a car!</h3>
      <br />
      <p>You will have to help us make the final decision though since you will have to live with the selection you make. Time is very short so we need a fast decision. I have listed the cars to choose from below. You should make 2 choices, since some of these are very popular and may sell before we can make it back to the lot.</p>

         <p> This is the cheapest to buy, insure, and get parts for. It has 101K miles on it, and a new paint job. If you choose this car we will put new tires and tint the windows for you. Think of this one as a comfy people carrier. (V6 front wheel drive)

         <br />
         <p> This one has the most utility. It has 130K miles on it, and is not the one pictured. Yours would be dark grey with a painted (same as truck) bed cover. (counld not find a picture of it)If you choose this car we will put new tires and tint the windows for you. Think of this one as the I can help my friends move. (V6 rear wheel drive, MANUAL TRANSMISSION)

         <br />
         <p> This one looks the coolest and has decent utility. It has 130K+ miles on it. It has some fading on the very top (paint), and a little on the hood. It is a dodge, so it will require diligent maintenance i.e. oil changes, tire rotations, etc. It drives well and is ok comfy.. (V6 rear wheel drive)

         <br />
         <p> This one is very comfy, has leather seats, and is the highest safty rated car on the road. It is not the most expensive in this lineup but does have the highest miles, 164K. This car was very popular at the dealership with a line of people waiting to test drive it, so it may not be available when you get this message.  It is also a few dollars more to insure this car. (Imported) (V6, Front Wheel Drive)
