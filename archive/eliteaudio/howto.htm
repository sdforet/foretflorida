				 <h2 class="titleOne">Choose the right Design</h2>
						 <p class="howtotext">
						 Choosing the right design and space is probably the most crucial step in creating
						 your home theater. Even the best equipment in a poorly chosen space will not perform its
						 best. The space should be large enough for your viewing needs and have adequate light control
						 to eliminate unwanted artifacts from your screen. Once the location is chosen, develop a style
						 that fits your personal taste, don't just choose something similar to another theater, you will be 
						 more satisfied with a truly customized space that is unique to you.
				 		 </p>
						 
				 <h2 class="titleOne">Choose the right Equipment</h2>
						 <p class="howtotext">
						 Choosing the right equipment for your theater, is the second most important step in your quest for Elite sound.
						 Remember this crucial bit of advice, the most expensive equipment is not always the best equipment. A lot of
						 money is wasted on exotic construction materials and finishes, that don't really affect the quality of the sound. 
						 Buying the cheapest equipment is not going to be you best bet either. Trust your ears, bring in you favorite movie 
						 or music selection to the showroom and watch/listen to it on the equipment you are thinking about purchasing. This
						 will give you a much greater feel for the everyday performance of the equipment. 
				 		 </p>
						 
				 <h2 class="titleOne">Choose the right Installer</h2>
						 <p class="howtotext">
						 If you are the type that can "do it yourself" then great have fun installing and tweaking you new theater. If you are
						 not, then make sure that the installer you choose has competent local references. Most theater owners are more than happy
						 to show off their gear and rooms, so ask the prospective installer to see some previous work. Go and talk to the other 
						 customers about not only the quality of the finished project but the timeliness of completion and the contractor's
						 willingness to make changes and adapt to your schedule. These things are crucial, and if you follow them they will
						 make the process enjoyable for everyone.

		 <p id="lowertext">Today's multi-million dollar movies with all their special effects and sound
		  demand a fully integrated home theater. The picture is only half of the equation, the aural scope of modern cinema is where
		 the true magic happens. When the sound and the picture work together seamlessly a good movie can become a great movie.
