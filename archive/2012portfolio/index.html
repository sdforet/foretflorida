                <p class="slidertext">This digital portion of my resume is designed to let your company know a little more about me and what I have the potential to do as a member of your team. Thank you for taking the time to browse over my work and I hope that your search for the right developer is going well. </p>
               <p class="slidertext"> I am originally from South Louisiana, and although my accent is gone, I am still a Cajun. I now live in Gainesville with my family and have been attending classes at Santa Fe College since fall 2011. I have completed my A.A. degree and will finish my A.S. in August. My goal is to find a great company to work with as I continue to develop my skills as a programmer while completing my education at Santa Fe. The academic work is fun and challenging, but I am anxious to test my new skills in a professional environment.</p>
               <p class="slidertext"> While I donâ€™t always take myself too seriously, I consider myself to be a good communicator and enjoy a professional environment. I am loyal and committed to the core, and would love the opportunity to learn in a professional environment, especially one that I could remain in and cultivate my abilities for years.</p>
